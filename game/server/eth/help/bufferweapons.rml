Fundamentally there are two categories of weapons in ROTC: Those that bypass a CAT's barrier (colored red/blue) and those that bypass a CAT's health buffer (colored orange/green).

Most weapons fall into the former category and thus will often require multiple hits in quick succession to do a respectable amount of permanent damage to an enemy CAT.
