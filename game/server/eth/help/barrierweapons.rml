Fundamentally there are two categories of weapons in ROTC: Those that bypass a CAT's barrier (colored red/blue) and those that bypass a CAT's health buffer (colored orange/green).

There's currently only one weapon that falls into the latter category: The Sniper ROFL. 
Weapons in this category have the advantage of dealing health damage with a hit (no matter how much health buffer the enemy has) but also have the disadvantage of causing the enemy to activate a temporary barrier that will make him invulnerable to weapons in this category for a short time.
